    <p class="lead">"Autodidacticism or self-education is education without the guidance of masters or institutions. Generally, autodidacts are individuals who choose the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time." - Wikipedia</p>
    <p class='text-justify'>A bit pretentious but this site serves two functions: It serves as a repository for my personal educational projects (and supporting documentation) as well as a platform for Data APIs that serve datasets that are either generated by said projects or personal data collection. </p>
    <p class='test-justify'>Is this website my personal programming portfolio? Honestly, yes. The Applications section of the website functions more as a traditional programming portfolio but I will probably link this entire site in a resume at some point. Autodidacticism serves more as a means of keeping track of the resources that I use for research and software development. I am far more of a back end oriented individual and do not have a real eye for design/front end so expect the look and feel of the site to be VERY basic.</p>
