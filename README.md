# Autodidacticism Django App
The source code for the Autodidacticism website written in python using the Django library. The Documentation assumes a base understanding of the Django framework and application structure and seeks to explain the core components of the Project and all of the interactions between Applications.

## Hosting
TODO: Add An example of how to host once hosting becomes possible.

## Applications
There are three main objectives that the Django project seeks to meet:
* The hosting of personal projects/applications
* Providing a central repository for the educational resources that I make use of and providing me a means of creating and hosting my own resources (articles, research papers, documentation) on various topics.
* Hosting Web Data APIs that serve data that is either collected by my web scraping application (see objective 1.) or other forms of data collection.

Based on these three functions, there are three main applications that form the core of the Django project:
* `web_core`
* `education_resources`
* `data_api`

**Each of the Django Apps in the project are documented in the `resources/documentation` section of the repository.**
